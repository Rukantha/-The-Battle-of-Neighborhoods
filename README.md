Battle of Neighborhoods of -Port Elizabeth & Durban in South Africa  
Capstone Project   


1.  Introduction / Business Problem  
 
- When thinking about relocating to a new city or country for work purposes or to start a new life, or 
to go for a holiday destination people tend to research areas before moving. This research includes 
population rate, average house price, school ratings, crime rates, weather conditions, recreational 
facilities, holiday destinations-tourism, Carnivals and Sports events/activity.  etc. 
 
- Based on the above, a search engine algorithm would be an efficient tool to use that will allow users 
to enter cities and get the neighborhood name that best suits their lifestyle or living conditions.  - In this project, we will study in detail the area classification using foursquare data and machine learning segmentation and clustering. And segment areas of two cities based on the most common 
places captured from Foursquare. 

 
- This could be done as the aim of this Project using an algorithm (Using segmentation and clustering) 
that will perform an extensive analysis on 1. The similarities and dissimilarities between neighborhoods in the two cities of the user’s 
search criteria, and  2. Determine which neighborhoods best suits their lifestyle.  
For this project, I will be developing a recommendation system using the Port Elizabeth  and Durban 
cities in South Africa as my search criteria: 
** Brief Information About: Port Elizabeth and Durban **  
- Port Elizabeth  and Durban are two major cities in South Africa Both the cities become a center of attention for residential, holiday destinations-tourism, education, job employment, shopping and sports activity. Both cities are well known in South Africa and become the top choice for local and foreign communities. Also for the best holiday destinations in the world because of its Mediterranean climate, vibrant nightlife, Michelin Star restaurants, scenic coastal drives, staggering mountain landscape and friendly people; the latter holds the top spot as a family-friendly destination and for its wonderful beaches and water activities. -  



Port Elizabeth 
Port Elizabeth or The Bay[2] (Xhosa: iBhayi; Afrikaans: Die Baai [di ˈbɑːi]) is one of the major cities in 
South Africa; it is situated in the Eastern Cape Province, 770 km (478 mi) east of Cape Town. The city, 
often shortened to PE and nicknamed "The Windy City", stretches for 16 km along Algoa Bay, and is one 
of the major seaports in South Africa. Port Elizabeth is the southernmost large city on the African 
continent, just farther south than Cape Town. Port Elizabeth was founded as a town in 1820 to house 
British settlers as a way of strengthening the border region between the Cape Colony and the Xhosa. It 
now forms part of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality, which has a population of over 1.3 
million.

Durban 
Durban (Zulu: eThekwini, from itheku meaning "bay/lagoon") is the third most populous city in South 
Africa—after Johannesburg and Cape Town—and the largest city in the South African province of 
KwaZulu-Natal. Located on the east coast of South Africa, Durban is famous for being the busiest port in 
the country. It is also seen as one of the major Centres of tourism because of the city's warm subtropical 
climate and extensive beaches. Durban forms part of the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality, which 
includes neighboring towns and has a population of about 3.44 million,[7] making the combined 
municipality one of the biggest cities on the Indian Ocean coast of the African continent. It is also the 
second most important manufacturing hub in South Africa after Johannesburg. In 2015, Durban was 
recognized as one of the New7Wonders Cities (along with Vigan, Doha, La Paz, Havana, Beirut, and Kuala 
Lumpur).
